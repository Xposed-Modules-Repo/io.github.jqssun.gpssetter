## Motivation

An increasing number of apps are abusing the location permission for tracking purposes, preventing the user from using the app without granting the permission. Traditionally on Android, modifying the response from android server is done using the mock location provider - however, the availability of this feature is device dependent. Additionally, some apps have started explicitly checking for signals regarding whether the location provided is reliable. This module aims to mitigate this by providing an ability to either,
1. hook the app itself to modify the location it receives, or
2. hook the system server if the app explicitly checks for whether itself is being hooked

Specifically, in the case of hooking just the app, it intercepts [`android.location.Location`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/Location) and [`android.location.LocationManager`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/LocationManager) methods including
- [`getLatitude()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/Location#getLatitude())
- [`getLongitude()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/Location#getLongitude())
- [`getAccuracy()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/Location#getAccuracy())
- [`getLastKnownLocation(java.lang.String)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/LocationManager#getLastKnownLocation(java.lang.String))

## Compatibility

- Android 8.1+ (tested up to Android 16 Beta 2)

- üçÄ (New) Supports a fully FLOSS build flavor - including all underlying dependencies
- üñ≤Ô∏è (New) Allows adjusting location on the fly via an on-screen joystick overlay
- üéâ (New) Features custom designed resource bundles with updated dependent libraries
- üé≤ Allows using a live updating random location in the vicinity of the set point
- üî• Compatible with latest Material Design
